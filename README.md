# OrderBook
The OrderBook Group Project is a web-based application designed to allow traders to buy and sell stocks. 
It was created as a summative assessment of the skills learned during the Albany Beck Tech Pioneers program. 
This is our first submission, but we have plans to improve our documentation (both in the code and on Confluence), 
add more links to our user interface for easier navigation, implement a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, and deploy 
our app on an EC2 server. Please follow this link for the Confluence page:
